 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written n!
 (pronounced “n factorial”) and is defined as follows:
 
      n!=n·(n-1)·(n-2)·...·1 (for values of n greater than or equal to 1)
 and
      n!=1 (for n = 0)
 
 Example: 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, which is 120.
      a) Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial.
 
      b) Write a program that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e by using the formula:
 
      c) Write a program that computes the value of (e)x by using the formula
